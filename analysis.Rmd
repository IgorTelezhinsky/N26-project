# Description

The analysis consists of 2 parts:

1. [clusteringAnalysis](clusteringAnalysis.html)
2. [predictionAnalysis](predictionAnalysis.html)

The project is implemented in *Rmarkdown* and supporting code files in R: *prepareData.R*, *analyseK.R*, *predictionAnalysis.R*. You can look at and read the analysis as html, or you can open *.Rmd files in Rstudio and Knit them to HTML (with a button). It will take ~20 min to process/knit each of the analyses. All the required packages should be installed for this. For the your tests you can use the code provided at the bottom of each analysis. It is much faster, because the whole analysis will not be performed. Have a nice reading!
